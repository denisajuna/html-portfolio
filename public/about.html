<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As CEO and Co-founder, I firmly believe that setting up and adhering to key performance indicators are completely mandatory for our team's success. And it has paid off! Last year alone we were able to deliver amazing ROI of up to 400% for our clients compared to the calculated media value â€“ not to mention we saved them up to 70% in advertisement costs.</p>
